# YC-PCA
Decompose yield curves using principal component analysis. Data sourced from Quandl.

# HOWTO
Create an account on Quandl, and an api key will be added to your account. You can use this key to access any of the free Quandl data, which corresponds to the curves not starting with 'YC' in the PCA.py file. If you want to use the 'YC' curves, you need to purchase a subscription to [this](https://www.quandl.com/data/YC-Global-Yield-Curves) yield curve database.
